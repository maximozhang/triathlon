# Triathlon is Funsies

## Swim

<body>
Triathlon is one of the sports that the great Maximo Zhang participates frequently in, and enjoys very much. It consists of three different sports combined into one. Starting with the swimming, competitiors swim through the cold ocean for a certain distance, usually in wetsuits or if they are insane, swimsuits.

## Bike

Biking is probably the worst part of triathlon. Very tiring for legs with your lactic acid, very high heartrate, highest technicalities, and this is the part I always fail. I be falling every like every race, cuz I wear cleats on the bike and I'm connected to it. Also theres a lot of stuff you can do to be faster, but also increases your chances of falling. All in all, 4/10. <br>

## Run

Run is actually fun unless you are running on sand. Last time I had to run on sand and up a 45 percent slope and the inner quads cramped and that was like the worst 5k I ever ran. I ran a 24 minutes, during the triathlon so it wasn't terrible but a really old guy beat me and it was embarrasing. <br>
